    "overview": "Sage (Salvia officinalis) is one of the oldest and most revered medicinal herbs, with its name derived from the Latin 'salvere' meaning 'to cure' or 'to save.' This aromatic Mediterranean herb has been valued for thousands of years for its powerful antiseptic, astringent, and cognitive-enhancing properties. It is particularly noted for supporting oral health, reducing excessive sweating, and easing menopausal symptoms.",
    "traditionalUses": "Ancient physicians including Dioscorides, Pliny, and Galen recommended sage as a diuretic, hemostatic, emmenagogue, and tonic. Greek and Roman healers used it for digestive complaints and to improve memory. European herbalists employed it for sore throats, mouth inflammations, excessive sweating, and to dry up breast milk when weaning. It was traditionally believed to promote longevity - an old proverb asks 'Why should a man die whilst sage grows in his garden?'",
    "modernResearch": "Modern studies have validated many traditional uses. Research demonstrates anticholinesterase activity that may improve memory and attention in healthy adults. Clinical trials show efficacy for reducing hot flashes and night sweats in menopausal women. Studies confirm significant antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and hypoglycemic effects. The rosmarinic acid, carnosic acid, and carnosol content contribute to its strong antioxidant properties.",
    "howToUse": "For sore throat and mouth health: Prepare a strong tea and use as a gargle several times daily. For digestive support: Drink tea after meals. For excessive sweating or hot flashes: Drink cold sage tea (hot tea may induce sweating). For cognitive support: Take as tea or tincture regularly. Note: Limit medicinal use to 2 months due to thujone content."
